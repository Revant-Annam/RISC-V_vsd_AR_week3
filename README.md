# RISC-V_vsd_AR_week3
This repository documents the verification of synthesized hardware with Gate-Level Simulation (GLS) and performing Static Timing Analysis (STA). It includes practical experiments using open-source tools like Icarus Verilog for GLS and OpenSTA for STA to verify post-synthesis functionality and timing performance of the BabySoC design.
