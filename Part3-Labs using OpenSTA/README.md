# Part 3 ‚Äì Generate Timing Graphs with OpenSTA

## Understanding of OpenSTA tool -

### 1. OpenSTA: Inputs and Outputs ‚öôÔ∏è

* **Inputs:** OpenSTA needs three essential files to perform its analysis:
  1.  **Synthesized Netlist (`.v`):** This is the gate-level Verilog file produced by your synthesis tool (Yosys). It describes your design as a network of standard cells. **This is the circuit to be analyzed.**
  2.  **Standard Cell Library (`.lib`):** This is the Liberty timing library for your technology (e.g., SKY130). It contains the timing information for every logic gate, including propagation delays, setup times, and hold times. **This file defines how fast the circuit's components are.**
  3.  **Synopsys Design Constraints (`.sdc`):** This is a text file you create. It defines the timing requirements for your design, such as the clock period and I/O delays. **This file sets the performance goals the circuit must meet.**

* **Outputs:** The primary output of OpenSTA is not a file but text-based information printed to the console (which you can redirect to a file).
  1.  **Timing Reports:** This is the main output, showing detailed information about the timing paths in your design, including the calculated **slack**.
  2.  **Checks and Status Reports:** These are useful for debugging, highlighting issues like unconstrained paths or un-clocked registers.

### 2. The Synopsys Design Constraints (`.sdc`) File üìù

The **`.sdc` (Synopsys Design Constraints)** file contains all the **timing and design intent constraints** used by STA tools. It defines how the tool interprets **clocking, input/output delays, loads, and operating conditions** to analyze timing paths correctly.

### üß© Commonly Used SDC Commands

Of course. Here is a clean, well-formatted table of common SDC (Synopsys Design Constraints) commands used in Static Timing Analysis.

***

### ## Common SDC Timing Commands

| **Command** | **Purpose** | **Common Syntax** | **Example** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

### 3. Basic OpenSTA Commands ‚öôÔ∏è

You typically run **OpenSTA** (Static Timing Analyzer) either in an **interactive shell** or by providing a **TCL script**. The commands must be entered in a logical sequence to load the libraries, design netlist, timing constraints, and then perform timing analysis.

### Common OpenSTA Tcl Commands

| **Command** | **Purpose** | **Common Syntax** | **Example** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`read_liberty`** | Loads a standard cell timing library (`.lib`). Use `-max` for setup checks (slow corner) and `-min` for hold checks (fast corner). | `read_liberty [-max \| -min] <path_to_lib.lib>` | `read_liberty -max slow.lib`<br>`read_liberty -min fast.lib` |
| **`read_verilog`** | Reads the synthesized gate-level Verilog netlist into the tool. | `read_verilog <path_to_netlist.v>` | `read_verilog my_design.synth.v` |
| **`link_design`** | Links the netlist instances to the corresponding cells in the loaded libraries. The argument must be the top-level module name. | `link_design <top_module_name>` | `link_design vsdbabysoc` |
| **`create_clock`** | Defines a clock source, specifying its period and the port where it's applied. This is the most fundamental timing constraint. | `create_clock -name <clk_name> -period <val> [get_ports <port>]` | `create_clock -name sys_clk -period 10.0 [get_ports clk]` |
| **`read_sdc`** | Reads a Synopsys Design Constraints (`.sdc`) file, which contains all timing constraints (`create_clock`, I/O delays, false paths, etc.). | `read_sdc <path_to_sdc_file>` | `read_sdc my_design.sdc` |
| **`report_checks`** | Reports **detailed timing path information**, including delay, required time, and slack for setup (max) and hold (min) paths. | `report_checks [-path_delay min_max] [-digits <N>]` | `report_checks -path_delay min_max -digits 4` |



### 4. Starting OpenSTA


### 5. Walkthrough of a Basic Example

#### **Netlist**

```verilog
module top (in1, in2, clk1, clk2, clk3, out);
  input in1, in2, clk1, clk2, clk3;
  output out;
  wire r1q, r2q, u1z, u2z;

  DFF_X1 r1 (.D(in1), .CK(clk1), .Q(r1q));
  DFF_X1 r2 (.D(in2), .CK(clk2), .Q(r2q));
  BUF_X1 u1 (.A(r2q), .Z(u1z));
  AND2_X1 u2 (.A1(r1q), .A2(u1z), .ZN(u2z));
  DFF_X1 r3 (.D(u2z), .CK(clk3), .Q(out));
endmodule 
```

#### **Objective**

Find the worst-case hold and setup slack in the netlist (example1.v).

#### **Commands to Enter**

```tcl
# --- OpenSTA Timing Analysis Script for example1 ---

# 1. Load the Standard Cell Library
# This command reads the Nangate 45nm library. The .lib file is crucial as it
# contains all the timing information (propagation delays, setup/hold times) for
# the logic gates used in the design.
read_liberty /OpenSTA/examples/nangate45_typ.lib.gz

# 2. Read the Synthesized Netlist
# This reads the gate-level Verilog file that describes the circuit's structure
# and the interconnection of all the logic gates.
read_verilog /OpenSTA/examples/example1.v

# 3. Link the Design to the Library
# This essential step connects the gates in the Verilog netlist to their
# corresponding timing models in the loaded library, making the design "timing-aware."
link_design top

# 4. Define the Clock Constraint
# This is the most important constraint. It sets the performance target by defining
# a clock named 'clk' with a 10ns period (100 MHz frequency) and applies this
# constraint to the design's three clock input ports.
create_clock -name clk -period 10 {clk1 clk2 clk3}

# 5. Define Input Delays
# This command models the external world. It tells the tool that for any timing
# path starting at inputs 'in1' or 'in2', the data signal arrives 1ns *after*
# the rising edge of the 'clk'.
set_input_delay -clock clk 1 {in1 in2}

# 6. Perform a Preliminary Check (Optional, but good practice)
# This command finds the raw longest (max) and shortest (min) combinational path
# delays. It's not a full timing report with slack, but it gives a quick
# indication of the design's overall speed.
report_checks -path_delay min_max

# 7. Generate the Full Setup Timing Report
# This is the main analysis command. It performs a full setup analysis and generates
# a detailed report for the 10 worst-offending paths. The report will show the
# complete delay breakdown, the required time, and the final slack value.
# The output of this command is what you analyze for timing violations.
report_timing -nworst 10

# 8. Exit the Tool
# Exits the OpenSTA interactive shell.
exit
```

#### **Output Received**

#### **Analysis of the Output**

* **Hold Analysis:**
  1.  **Startpoint**: in1 (input port clocked by clk)
  2.  **Endpoint:** r1 (rising edge-triggered flip-flop clocked by clk)
  3.  **Path Group:** clk (the timing path is being analyzed)
  4.  **Path Type:** min (the analysis is a hold time check)
  5.  **Data Arrival Time**: The earliest possible time a signal can travel from its startpoint to its endpoint which is the sum of min delays in the timing path.
  6.  **Data Required Time**: The earliest moment the data is allowed to change at the input of the capture flip-flop.
  7.  **Slack**: This is the difference between the **Arrival Time** and the **Required Time**. If it's positive, the path has no violation. If it's negative, it's a timing violation. Here it is 0.10ns which is positive and hence there is no timing violation. 

Slack calculation:

$$Slack_{hold} = \text{Arrival Time}_{min} - \text{Required Time}_{min}$$

Hold time constraint:

$$T_{cq_{min}} + T_{logic_{min}} > T_{hold}$$

* **Setup Analysis:**
  1.  **Startpoint**: r2 (rising edge-triggered flip-flop clocked by clk)
  2.  **Endpoint:** r3 (rising edge-triggered flip-flop clocked by clk)
  3.  **Path Group:** clk (the timing path is being analyzed)
  4.  **Path Type:** max (the analysis is a setup time check)
  5.  **Data Arrival Time**: The latest possible time a signal can travel from its startpoint to its endpoint which is the sum of max delays in the timing path.
  6.  **Data Required Time**: The time by which the data must arrive at the capture flip-flop's input to be reliably captured by the next clock edge.
  7.  **Slack**: This is the difference between the **Required Time** and the **Arrival Time**. If it's positive, the path has no violation. If it's negative, it's a timing violation. Here it is 9.83ns which is positive and hence there is no timing violation. 

Slack calculation:

$$Slack_{setup} = \text{Required Time}_{max} - \text{Arrival Time}_{max}$$

Setup time constraint:

$$T_{cq_{max}} + T_{logic_{max}} + T_{setup} < \text{Clock Period}$$

### Performing STA on `VSDBabySoC` üìà

#### **Step 1: Prerequisites**

In the `VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src` directory I have made a `vsdbabysoc_min_max_delays.tcl` for perfoming the setup and hold time checks for the VSDBabySoC. The contents of `.tcl` file can be run individually in the OpenSTA tool also. The contents of the file:

```tcl
# Liberty files
read_liberty -min /data/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
read_liberty -max /data/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
read_liberty -min /data/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/lib/avsdpll.lib
read_liberty -max /data/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/lib/avsdpll.lib
read_liberty -min /data/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/lib/avsddac.lib
read_liberty -max /data/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/lib/avsddac.lib

# Synthesized design
read_verilog /data/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/output/synth/vsdbabysoc.synth.v

# Link top module
link_design vsdbabysoc

# SDC constraints
read_sdc /data/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/sdc/vsdbabysoc_synthesis.sdc

# Timing report
report_checks
```

#### **Step 2: Correcting the error**

With the help of docker command we can run the `.tcl` file,

```
docker run -it -v $HOME:/data opensta /data/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/vsdbabysoc_min_max_delays.tcl
```

But this resulted in the following error,

<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ec40dbb-5122-4a09-a864-ce13a9d3ca56" />

This error occurs because the Liberty (.lib) file format does not support // for single-line comments. The parser fails when it finds this syntax, especially when a { character follows it. To fix this, inspect avsdpll.lib around line 54 and correct the comment formatting.

In the `avsdpll.lib` line 54:
```
//pin (GND#2) {
//  direction : input;
//  max_transition : 2.5;
//  capacitance : 0.001;
//}
```

This needs to be converted into:
```
/*
pin (GND#2) {
  direction : input;
  max_transition : 2.5;
  capacitance : 0.001;
}
*/
```

A similar error occured in line 68.

#### **Step 3: Run `.tcl` file in OpenSTA**

After correcting the errors using the same docker command we can run the `.tcl` file. The timing report generated is 

<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/972afbc2-299e-4aa1-a506-5e15fa17675e" />


<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09ec4f40-b4af-4b59-800b-92f208e80a6e" />


As the slack is positive for both the hold and setup time analysis there is no timing violation.


#### **Step 4: Analyze Your Report**

Open the generated `vsdbabysoc_timing_report.txt` file.

  * **What is the worst slack value?** Is it positive or negative?
  * If it's positive, your design meets the 50 MHz timing goal. ‚úÖ
  * If it's negative, your design fails to meet timing. Look at the path details: which cells or nets in the `VSDBabySoC` design are contributing the most delay? This is your **critical path**.
